    "Welcome to this course capstone, where you will be applying everything you have learned throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "You've joined a fintech startup tasked with improving customer loan offers. Using the [ðŸ”—Bondora P2P Loans](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcobeyer/bondora-p2p-loans?select=LoanData.csv) dataset, you'll build build insights about what factors help determine a person's interest rate. You will work your way to creating a predictive model to estimate loan interest rates, which will guide your company in personalizing loan terms efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The features used in this lab are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `VerificationType`: Method used for loan application data verification\n",
    "- `Age`: Age of the borrower (years)\n",
    "- `AppliedAmount`: Amount applied\n",
    "- `Amount`: Amount the borrower received\n",
    "- `Interest`: Interest rate\n",
    "- `LoanDuration`: The loan term\n",
    "- `Education`: Education of the borrower\n",
    "- `EmploymentDurationCurrentEmployer`: Employment time with the current employer\n",
    "- `HomeOwnershipType`: Home ownership type\n",
    "- `IncomeTotal`: Total income\n",
    "- `ExistingLiabilities`: Borrower's number of existing liabilities\n",
    "- `RefinanceLiabilities`:  The total amount of liabilities after refinancing\n",
    "- `Rating`: Bondora Rating issued by the Rating model\n",
    "- `NoOfPreviousLoansBeforeLoan`: Number of previous loans\n",
    "- `AmountOfPreviousLoansBeforeLoan`: Value of previous loans\n",
